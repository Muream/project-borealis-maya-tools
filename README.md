# Setup
* Navigate to the folder you want the tools to be (next to the `pb` directory is a good idea but not necessary).
* Right click in an empty space > open git bash here
* Type `git clone https://projectborealisgitlab.site/project-borealis/creatives/animation/tools.git` and press enter.
* Copy `ProjectBorealis.mod`  in `Documents/maya/modules/`.
* Open the file you just copied in any text editor and replace both instances of `/path/to/tools` with the actual path where you cloned the tools. For me its `D:/projects/project-borealis/tools`
* Start Maya, you will be asked the location of the `raw-asset` directory. This is really important, without this Maya will not be able to resolve the textures, references and any other path.  
  You can always change this later via the Project Borealis menu in general > Set Assets Directory.
